##### New: Cortex XDR disconnected endpoints

- New: A Job to periodically query disconnected Cortex XDR endpoints with a provided last seen time range playbook input.
The Collected data, if found will be generated to a CSV report, including a detailed list of the disconnected endpoints.
The report will be sent to the recipient's provided email addresses in the playbook input.
The playbook includes an incident type with a dedicated layout to visualize the collected data.
To set the job correctly, you will need to.
1. Create a new recurring job.
2. Set the recurring schedule.
3. Add a name.
4. Set type to Cortex XDR disconnected endpoints.
5. Set this playbook as the job playbook.

The scheduled run time and the timestamp relative date should be identical,
If the job is recurring every 7 days, the time range should be 7 days as well.
