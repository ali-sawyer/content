comment: Redactindicator can help you to defang/redact any kind of indicator (IPv4, url, domain and email), IP addresses will be in the dotted representation like 8.8.8[.].8, all domains will be example[.]com. Optional you can define a "searchkey" which does not to be case sensitive, which will be replaced as <REDACTED>
