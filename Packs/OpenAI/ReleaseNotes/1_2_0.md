##### New: OpenAI v2

- This integration combines two previously existing integrations, `OpenAI` and `OpenAi ChatGPT v3`. It leverages the OpenAI and Azure OpenAI REST APIs to generate human-like responses to text prompts. The APIs provide access to OpenAI's powerful language models including the GPT-3.5 model series. These models can be easily adapted to your specific task including but not limited to content generation, summarization, semantic search, and natural language to code translation.
- Added new commands: *openai-answer-question* and *openai-summarize*.
