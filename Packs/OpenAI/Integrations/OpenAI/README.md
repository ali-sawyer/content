This integration leverages the OpenAI and Azure OpenAI REST APIs to generate human-like responses to text prompts. The APIs provide access to OpenAI's powerful language models including the GPT-3.5 model series. These models can be easily adapted to your specific task including but not limited to content generation, summarization, semantic search, and natural language to code translation.
This integration was integrated and tested with version 1 of the OpenAI API and version 2023-09-01-preview of the Azure OpenAI API.

Some changes have been made that might affect your existing content. 
If you are upgrading from a previous version of this integration, see [Breaking Changes](#breaking-changes-from-the-previous-version-of-this-integration-openai).

The impact of this incident can result in a significant loss or damage to the system and can severely impact the organization's reputation.\n\n3- Action or Recommendations:\nIt is of utmost importance to immediately respond to such an incident and take action to contain the malware and prevent further damage. Below are some recommendations that can help in addressing this incident:\n\n- First, isolate the infected machine from the network to contain the malware's spread.\n- Check other systems for similar indicators of compromise.\n- Perform a thorough analysis to identify the malware's behavior and its impact on the system.\n- If the malware is a known strain, make sure to scan all other systems and implement the appropriate patches and updates to eliminate it.\n- If a new strain of malware, submit it for analysis to security vendors and take action based on their recommendations.\n- Reset the user's password and monitor their activities.\n- Look for any signs of data exfiltration or other suspicious activities.\n- Train employees on how to be more vigilant and proactively identify potential security threats.\n\nBy following these recommendations, organizations can significantly reduce the impact of such incidents and protect their systems and data from further damage. It is essential to have an incident response plan in place to handle such incidents promptly and effectively. Organizations should also make sure to perform regular vulnerability and incident assessments to identify and address any potential security risks.",

### openai-completions

***
Enter an instruction and watch the API respond with a completion that attempts to match the context or pattern you provided.

#### Base Command

`openai-completions`

#### Input

| **Argument Name** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| prompt | Instruction. | Required | 
| model | The model which will generate the completion. Some models are suitable for natural language tasks, others specialize in code. For Azure OpenAI, this should be the name of the DEPLOYMENT, not the generic model name. Possible values are: gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct, text-davinci-003, text-curie-001, text-babbage-001, text-ada-001, code-davinci-002, code-cushman-001. Default is gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct. | Optional | 
| temperature | Controls randomness: Lowering results in less random completions. Default is 0.7. | Optional | 
| max_tokens | The maximum number of tokens to generate. Default is 256. | Optional | 
| top_p | Controls Diversity via nucleus sampling: 0.5 means half of all likihood-weighted options are considered. Default is 1. | Optional | 
| frequency_penalty | How much to penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far. Decreases the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim. Default is 0. | Optional | 
| presence_penalty | How much to penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far. Increases the model's likelihood to talk about new topics. Default is 0. | Optional | 
| best_of | Generates best_of completions server-side and returns the "best" (the one with the lowest log probability per token). Results can't be streamed. When used with n, best_of controls the number of candidate completions and n specifies how many to return – best_of must be greater than n. Note- Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for max_tokens and stop. This parameter cannot be used with gpt-35-turbo. Default is 1. | Optional | 
| stop | Up to four sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text won't contain the stop sequence. | Optional | 

#### Context Output

| **Path** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI.Completions.id | string | Id of the returned completion. | 
| OpenAI.Completions.model | string | The model which will generate the completion. | 
| OpenAI.Completions.text | string | Completed text generated by OpenAI? | 

#### Command example
```!openai-completions prompt="Give me some characteristics of a phishing email"```
#### Context Example
```json
{
    "OpenAI": {
        "Completions": {
            "id": "cmpl-7WRxVmzy5SoGNpus2lfau6oik29li",
            "model": "text-davinci-003",
            "text": "\n\n1. Unfamiliar sender: The sender of the email may be someone you don't recognize or an email address that looks suspicious.\n\n2. Urgent requests: The email may contain urgent requests for you to take action, such as clicking a link or providing personal information.\n\n3. Poor grammar and spelling: Phishing emails often contain poor grammar and spelling mistakes.\n\n4. Suspicious links: The email may contain links to websites that look legitimate but are actually malicious.\n\n5. Attachments: The email may contain attachments that could contain malicious software."
        }
    }

## Additional Considerations for this version
* This integration combines two previously existing integrations: `OpenAI` and `OpenAi ChatGPT v3`.
* The command *chatgpt-send-prompt* (in integration `OpenAi ChatGPT v3`) is now the *openai-chatgpt* commmand.
* This integration supports both OpenAI (api.openai.com) and Azure OpenAI. Ensure you have the 'Use Azure OpenAI?' checkbox selected if you want to use Azure.
* This integration supports both the Chat endpoint (via command *openai-chatgpt*) and Completions endpoint (via command *openai-completions*). Ensure you are using the intended command.
